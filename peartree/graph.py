    Takes in a feed with a series of settings and produces two results: \
    a table of edge costs and a table of stop (or nodes).

    Output tables represent the two primary components of a network graph: \
    the graph nodes and vertices. This method wraps the primary edge and wait \
    times generator with a few additional validation checks and summary steps.

    Parameters
    ———————
    Feed : ptg.gtfs.Feed
        A partridge feed object, holding related schedule information as pandas
        DataFrames for the busiest day in the available schedule.
    target_time_start : float
        Start time in hours (on a 24-hour range). This will be used to \
        determine what part of the available selected schedule to subselect. \
        For example, you could set 7.5, which would be read as 7.5 hours past \
        midnight and converted into seconds.
    target_time_end : float
        End time in hours (on a 24-hour range). This will be used to \
        determine what part of the available selected schedule to subselect. \
        For example, you could set 13.5, which would be read as 17.5 hours \
        past midnight and converted into seconds.
    fallback_stop_cost : float
        This is measured in seconds. So, if the value is 600, it will equate \
        to a 10 minute fallback cost. The fallback stop cost is used if \
        peartree is unable to determine a time between arrivals for a \
        specific route. This can happen when there is only one arrival in \
        the considered time frame. In such situations, the fallback value \
        is used in lieu of a calculated standard wait time for that stop node.
    interpolate_times : bool
        Flag to check if there are intermediary stop in the GTFS feed that do \
        not have specific schedule data associated with them and to impute \
        the approximate arrival and departure times at each of these stops.
    stop_cost_method : Any
        A method is passed in here that handles an arrival time numpy array
        and, from that array, calcualtes a representative average wait time
        value, in seconds, for that stop.
    use_multiprocessing : bool
        This is a flag to tell the peartree model whether to attempt to \
        parallelize the computing of route-stop average wait times. It can \
        be helpful in speeding up evaluation of larger GTFS feeds.


    Returns
    ——
    summary_edge_costs : pd.DataFrame
        The edge DataFrame holds the from and to node (stop) ids, as well \
        as the cost calculated for traversing that edge.
    wait_times_by_stop : pd.DataFrame
        The node, or stops, DataFrame, holds the the stop id and the average \
        boarding cost for that node (calculated based on the distribution of \
        arrival times) within the evaluation time range for the target subset \
        of the feed schedule.
