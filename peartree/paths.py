    Convert a feed object into a NetworkX Graph, connect to an existing
    NetworkX graph if one is supplied

    Parameters
    ----------
    feed : partridge.feed
        A feed object from Partridge holding a representation of the
        desired schedule ids and their releated scheudule data from an
        operator GTFS
    start_time : int
        Represented in seconds after midnight; indicates the start time
        with which to take the subset of the target feed schedule
        to be used to measure impedance between stops along
        the route, as well as cost (wait time) to board at each stop
    end_time : int
        Represented in seconds after midnight; indicates the end time
        with which to take the subset of the target feed schedule
        to be used to measure impedance between stops along
        the route, as well as cost (wait time) to board at each stop
    name : str
        Name of the operator, which is used to create a unique ID for each
        of the stops, routes, etc. in the feed being supplied
    existing_graph : networkx.Graph
        An existing graph containing other operator or schedule data
    connection_threshold : float
        Treshold by which to create a connection with an existing stop
        in the existing_graph graph, measured in meters
    walk_speed_kmph : float
        Walk speed in km/h, that is used to determine the cost in time when
        walking between two nodes that get an internal connection created
    interpolate_times : bool
        A boolean flag to indicate whether or not to infill intermediary stops
        that do not have all intermediary stop arrival times specified in the
        GTFS schedule.
    impute_walk_transfers : bool
        A flag to indicate whether to add in walk connections between nodes
        that are close enough, as measured using connection_trheshold
    use_multiprocessing: bool
        A flag to indicate whether or not to leverage multiprocessing where
        available to attempt to speed up trivially parallelizable operations.

    Returns
    -------
    G
        networkx.Graph, the loaded, combined representation of the schedule
