Peartree is a library for converting `GTFS <https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/>`_ feed schedules into a representative directed network graph. The tool uses `Partridge <https://github.com/remix/partridge>`__ to convert the target operator schedule data into `Pandas <https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas>`__ dataframes and then `NetworkX <https://networkx.github.io/>`_ to hold the manipulated schedule data as a directed multigraph.

Installation
------------

.. code:: console

    pip install peartree

Usage
-----

See a full notebook at `this gist <https://gist.github.com/kuanb/c54d0ae7ee353cac3d56371d3491cf56>`_ to see a simple, step-by-step iPython Notebook pulling in an AC Transit GTFS feed and converting it to a NetworkX graph.

.. code:: python

    import peartree as pt

    path = 'path/to/actransit_gtfs.zip'

    # Automatically identify the busiest day and
    # read that in as a Partidge feed
    feed = pt.get_representative_feed(path)

    # Set a target time period to
    # use to summarize impedance
    start = 7*60*60  # 7:00 AM
    end = 10*60*60  # 10:00 AM

    # Converts feed subset into a directed
    # network multigraph
    G = pt.load_feed_as_graph(feed, start, end)

Examples

I've yet to produce a full how-to guide for this library, but will begin to populate this section with any blog posts or notebooks that I or others produce, that include workflows using Peartree.
